# Secretary Bundle - Secrets Manager for Symfony

## This Bundle Experimental!

Secrets are an important aspect of most applications you can build. How you store them, and keep them "secret" is a challenge.
Luckily, there are tools you can use to keep them all safe. 

Secretary is a tool to integrate your PHP application with these tools.

You can find more information about the underlying library over at [the main docs](https://github.com/secretary/php).

# Installation

```bash
$ composer require secretary/symfony
